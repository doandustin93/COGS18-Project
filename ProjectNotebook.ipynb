    "Out of the 80 characters currently available in the game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch, many players of the game have a character they consider their \"main\". In the community, a \"main\" is a character that someone plays both effectively and consistently, and one they usually have the most experience playing. Since my friends and I are always in the market to find a new main but also have a lot of issues figuring out who to play next, my project will provide that solution. It will give the user a character to play based on their preference for a particular role (i.e., Offensive, Defensive, Flexible) and their preferred playstyle within that role (e.g., All-Rounder, Hit and Run, Aura, etc.). These are inputted into a GUI created by <code>tkinter</code> and <code>tkinter.ttk</code>. The results are printed in the console and includes a little exerpt on what kind of fighter they are as well as the general play strategy for fighters of that particular type. Since this project utilizes <code>tkinter</code>, my entire project was written using Spyder as the interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some important notes in regards to my project**\n",
    "* My project also utilizes two modules that I've created: one is <code>Smash_Classes.py</code>, which has all the different archetype of characters classified into their respective classes (i.e., Offensive (Class), All-Rounder (Sub-Class/Archetype)) as well as their instance attributes and methods, while the other is <code>Roster_Creator.py</code> which has all the functions I made to create each archetype's roster. \n",
    "* I've included these two modules in my \"project\" folder within the same directory as my project. Because I wrote my project with these modules in the same folder, these two modules must also be saved in the same location as the main code in order for it to work. I've also included the .py file of my project, aptly named \"MY BEAUTIFUL SMASH APP ver 1.0.py\", in the same location. \n",
    "* I also included a \"requirements.txt\" file because I wasn't sure if tkinter would be considered a library, so I added that in there just in case. I also had to import the <code>random</code> and it's <code>choice</code> function for the same reasons. These imports are embedded within the functions, so it shouldn't cause an issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Citations #\n",
    "* Although I did use some of these codes as a foundation, it was more like I learned conceptually how it worked and applied them, since I wasn't sure if using tkinter required a specific syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tkinter Tutorials I used**\n",
    "* https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/ (to learn how to use tkinter)\n",
    "* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A_csP9drJw (for input/entry widgets in tkinter)\n",
    "* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E_fK5hCUnI (for how to make dropdown menus. I ultimately chose the Combobox method instead of OptionMenu, but I still took some conceptual ideas from this video)\n",
    "* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPUSBBD2OJw (for how to bind functions with buttons since I didn't really understand it when \"realpython\" introduced the concept)\n",

Although I don't think it's completely perfect yet, I'm pretty satisfied with what I have already. "
