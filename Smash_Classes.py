    Note: There is currently only one character that is considered an 'Aura' or at least uses 'Aura' attacks in the game. As such, it seemed like a waste since their playstyle is much more intricate than simply a character that uses an 'Aura' mechanic. This class was intentionally left here in case the game decides to add more characters of similar playstyles. Until then, the default values are set to the only character that uses it currently, even though the character, 'Lucario' is classified a different subtype. Furthermore, in reality, like 'Lucario', all characters have overlapping characteristics and archetypes, so these subclasses were decided based on which class better represented them the most.
